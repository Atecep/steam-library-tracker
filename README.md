## First launch

On first launch, Steam Library Tracker asks for the information required to access your Steam library.

You will need:

- a Steam Web API key
- your SteamID64

After your library is loaded, Steam Store and HowLongToBeat metadata are cached locally and can continue to update in the background.

## Smart Pick

**Smart Pick** helps choose a game from your library while respecting the filters you select.

Filters can include status, genre, game mode, Steam review score and HowLongToBeat duration. Games without metadata remain eligible when the selected filters do not require that metadata.

You can reroll a suggestion while keeping the same filters.

## HowLongToBeat

Steam Library Tracker can match games in your Steam library with HowLongToBeat and cache available completion-time estimates locally.

Automatic matching is intentionally conservative to reduce incorrect matches. If no reliable match is found, you can enter the game's HowLongToBeat ID manually from the game details window.

HowLongToBeat data is used for display, library sorting and optional Smart Pick duration filters.

## Local data

Steam Library Tracker stores user data outside the application folder so updates do not overwrite your settings, statuses or notes.

### Linux

```text
~/.local/share/SteamLibraryTracker/
```

### Windows

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\SteamLibraryTracker\
```

This folder contains files such as:

```text
config.json
library.db
```

Your local database contains personal game statuses and notes together with cached Steam and HowLongToBeat metadata.

## Backup and restore

Your local library database can be exported as a backup and restored later from within the app.

This is useful when moving to another computer or before making changes to your local installation.

## Updates

Steam Library Tracker can check GitHub Releases for newer versions.

When a newer version is available, the app displays an update notification with a link to the corresponding release.

## Privacy

Steam Library Tracker is a local desktop application.

Personal notes, statuses, configuration and cached library data remain on your computer unless you explicitly export or share them.

Steam and HowLongToBeat requests are used only to retrieve the metadata required by the app.

## Development

For instructions on running or building Steam Library Tracker from source, see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).
